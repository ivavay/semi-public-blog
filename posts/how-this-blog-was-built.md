I pretty much just followed an article that also had an accompanying Youtube tutorial to make this blog with 11ty and Netlify in less than an afternoon.

I'm trying to see if I can embed a code block bere too. This is the link in the header.

```html

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.15.0/themes/prism.min.css"></link>
}
```
This below is the link in the body.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.15.0/prism.min.js"></script>
```
