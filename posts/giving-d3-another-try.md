I've been doing Shirley Wu's intro to D3 course on Frontend Masters for maybe like 3 days now and I'm really enjoying it! This time around, I'm actually following along and making my own version of the flower pedal to add to the viz! So far, we've gotten from learning how to create SVG paths from scratch (which is tedious I don't know if I'll ever do that again), learned about `d3.select`(grabs the first element) and `d3.selectAll` (grabs all of the elements), and a little more about data binding using `selection.data()`. We also got an intro to `enter()` (which I think creates placeholder elements) and `append()`, which I need to read up on because I still don't really get how they work.  I like referring to this [resource](https://wattenberger.com/blog/d3) for reference!
