I wish the job recruitment process isn't the psychological warfare that many people have said it is. My body's been feeling tense and my sleep schedule has been a little whacked (sleeping directly after dinner at 8pm and waking up a little before 6am). I have put off finding a therapist for two (?) years since I've mostly been in the recovery phase and there hasn't been much stresses in life. But now since the job search is starting to pick up some momentum, I'm starting to feel like I can't relax/chill out throughout the day and that I get really nervous waiting for responses. 

I got asked in a chat which area of product design I'd want to focus and grow in (I guess they wanted to see if the work at the company can provide the opportunities to help me grow in the area that I'm interested in). But frankly, I do not know. I just want to hammer down the fundamentals in product design and learn the essentials so that I can grow to be a "good designer". There are area so many niches in the outskirt of product design that I dabble in (such as data viz and front-end dev) that I don't want to end up spreading myself even thinner. I ended up telling her that I just want to learn how to design in a way that makes the developers' life easier since design is a collaborative effort and not a standalone discipline. 

While I'm waiting from a response this week on potential next steps, I'm going try to distract myself by working on the D3 course and brushing up on some Figma skills by watching this Youtube livestreams. I'm grateful that I get to talk to a lot of my friends this week over video calls or in-person. Anyways, I just need to chill out üçÉ and listen to my indie-filled November playlist.
