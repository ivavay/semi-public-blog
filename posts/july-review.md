W﻿ow, it's been truly a hot minute but I found this blog again two years after my last post. I haven't been writing lately except for scribbling down thoughts in my journal or digitally on my computer under notes. I have a Substack, but I haven't posted anything on there in a while either. 

S﻿ome July recap: 

\- I﻿ started interviewing for front-end dev roles here in Taipei but quickly found out that I'm not ready for technical interviews yet.  

\- I﻿ started taking CS50 and have been going back into learning dev and building projects  *recreationally* (for now at least)*.*

\- I﻿'ve been really enjoying my summer with my brother here, exploring different restaurants and coffee/tea shops.  *Oolong lemon tea at 85 is the best.* 

\- I ﻿ signed up for a hackathon for women happening in Taipei in late August! Excited to actually build something fun this time.  

\-﻿ Watched Oppenheimer with C,V, and my bro.  Still perplexed by the ending. Truly a story on morals and ethics, makes you think. 

\-﻿ Grandma is doing okay but she has noticed that her memory is declining. Time perception is a little off and she knows it too. It takes longer for her to answer trivia questions we ask and even she herself finds it weird. 

\-﻿ Maple is happier here in Taiwan I think, because she gets to go out 3 times a day and the dogs here are nicer to her too. 

M﻿oving forward into August, I want to be more mindful of my energy level and do my best to intentionally better it. Meanwhile, I want to take on some US-based freelancing gigs if possible and just gain experience working with clients. I want to be more well-balanced with incorporating hobbies such as reading and drawing into my routines too, so I'm not always stressed about finding work.
