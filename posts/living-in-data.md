*\- “Data is not inert, yet its perceived passivity is one of its most dangerous properties…Putting an active form of the word “data” into common parlance could serve as a reminder that the system of data collection and use are humming with capacity for influence, action, and violence.”* 

*\- “…to view data not as a noun, or a verb, or a thing but as a system and a process”*

*\- “It’s particularly important to understand how schematic biases are amplified. How a decision made by a developer in a newsroom affects how a data point is stored, how a visualization is made, how a story is told, how a public understands. The structure built to store data affect show things are found and lost, how histories are written and who is included in them.”*

*\- “Algorithms can, in themselves, be biased. They can be coded to weight certain values over others, to reject conditions their authors have defined, to adhere to specific ideas of failure and success. But more often, and perhaps more dangerously, they act as magnifiers, metastasizing existing schematic biases and further darkening the empty spaces of omission.”*

*\- “...give the people who are reading the visualization some control as to what they see and from which angles. While static visualizations hand viewers a carefully framed postcard of the data, exploratory visualizations give users a vehicle, where they are free to roam the full terrain of the data, snapping photos as they go.”*

Superb storytelling about data, starting with a mini tour of its history and then moving on to the present. I really appreciate how he interweaves stories of people who work in this area and also some from his own. 

Halfway through the book and I’ve noticed the technical anecdotes always get kind of dense in the middle of chapters, but then the end of chapters always wrap the main points up with a more digestible way. 

Loved the beautiful data viz that accompanied each opening of a chapter :)
