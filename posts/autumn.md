Autumn brings about an ever-stretching afternoon of soft sun, with rays falling through the blinds, inundating the room with warmth that feels like a hug with a friend you haven’t seen in a long time. It’s in this moment that I realize how fortunate I am to be in this transitive period in my life, yes like fall, where I am allowed and empowered to explore the overlapping colors of my interests before tying myself down to a 9-5 corporate job. September has been a mosaic of reading multiple cross-genre books and pushing myself out of the comfort zone with reading slightly denser books, which included topics that ranged from visualizing data to climate change essays from diverse voices (a really hopeful and poetic read, I’d recommend). Between working out, taking naps, and eating food, I’ve also been job searching, trying to finesse my way through the job hunt through leveraging my connections, which honestly is pretty limited. I’m trying to focus on my craft and not be too hard on myself through this process.
