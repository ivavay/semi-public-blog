This is the first scatterplot that I've created while following this Udemy's course on D3! It displays the relationship between humidity and the apparent temperature in NYC from I'm not sure when. It's nice to create something from scratch without observable because that platform confuses me sometimes. Even though it was a lot to take in and I'm not sure if I understood every line of code, I still think I understood a lot more than I did a couple months back. Now, it's time to try to replicate the process with my own dataset!
