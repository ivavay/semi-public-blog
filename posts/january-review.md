january was a long month of rest and realigning myself to hobbies worth pursuing. i spent minimal time job searching this month, trying to not let the beginning of the year start off with chasing after things that don’t even want me back. i actually got two callbacks in the first week of jan, both startups, but they both ghosted me after lots of back and forth (one even including an interview and a design challenge). i intentionally applied to more design jobs in taipei and less so in the u.s. because im planning to move there in mid-feb. but anyways, depressing stuff aside, i spent a good half of jan playing tennis with my brother and picking up a bunch of different books spanning from asian-american memoirs to christian nonfictions.

towards the end of the month, i also began finding the creative urge to make crafts again, and so i started with crocheting coasters (this time with sunburst granny square pattern) and then bought a little sketchbook for watercoloring! i’m so stoked to meander the streets of taiwan and just take reference photos and draw. gosh, i just want to be back.

i started to gain some energy for self-learning again yesterday, and so i went through some lessons on the superhi d3 course and some on the udemy python course. it’s because i thought to myself, i should take advantage of all this downtime i have right now being in suburbia and all and just work through these courses that i have bought or been graciously given access to. in reflecting upon why i should continue with these online courses, i thought that getting more comfortable with d3 will eventually allow me to express data through creative storytelling, which in essence just sounds so damn cool and meaningful! and as for python, i might continue with the course as well because i want to be skillful in data literacy — it might come in handy later. even if i won’t just them in my design day job when i get one, being versed in these tools will still be fulfilling and enjoyable.

books i read this month

\- the garden city (5 ✨) — a really good reminder about work, rest, and interconnectedness of these with God’s design and intentions for us

\- two trees make a forest (5 ✨) — a travel memoir on taiwan!

\- the alignment problem (4 ✨ ) — about machine learning and human values, mostly story-driven but still too technical to follow along for me

\- all we can save (5 ✨ ) — a collection of essays by women working at the frontline of climate change
