february went by quickly to say the least! i started to pick up self-learning again, mainly in data viz. i'd say that i'm still in the exploratory phase in terms of finding which tools (ggplot2, talbeau, d3) i want to commit to learning and getting better at. the past few days, i've told myself that my goal this march is to finish the d3 course, and from there could i form an opinion on d3 as a medium for custom interactive data viz. 

my body's been feeling fatigued since the middle of feb due to some things that have happened abruptly and unexpectantly. though i wasn't super shocked consiously, i think unconsciously the news must've taken a toll on my body. and so, i haven't exercised since like a week and a half ago. taking it slowly and will ease back into exercising soon once i feel stronger physically. 

i didn't read any books this month just because i haven't had the mental and physical energy to. im getting better though! so here's to a fresh and hopefully energized new month of focused learning!
