I got back into 3D this month! The motivation came after interviewing for a 3D designer position in mid-March. I didn't get to move forward with it but I thought that I should work more on the craft so that I can have more work to show if a chance ever comes around next time! 

More to come process and learnings wised! But for now, that's it!
