I’ve always struggled deciding whether or not a piece of writing of mine should be public for everyone to see or private to me. Recently, I’ve came up with a framework for deciding which posts should be “semi-public” and which ones should just be for me to see. 

If it’s a rant or a piece of writing for you to “work your thoughts through”, then it should be private. If there’s any info in the piece that includes personal stuff you’re not intentionally trying to disclose, then it should be private. if it’s just a reedition of your journal entry, don’t make it public. 

When writing “semi-publicly”, which means that it’s available online but that you only share the link with trusted people, don’t mention the names of friends instead use “they” or their first initial instead. Also, when you start working professionally, don’t talk about work stuff in detail since all that may be NDA. Instead, you can talk about your design process learnings in vague terms. 

Learning to write with the right amount of granularity is something I’m still trying to learn.  

Update: Arianna sent me some texts and they’re so encouraging! She said that it’d be interesting to see the patterns in what past and future versions of you choose to write about :) And that my future work can inspired by my past work. Pretty much as a bridge between the past, present, and future. 

I love the idea of having my own corner of the internet for decades to come.
