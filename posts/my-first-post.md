I’ve always struggled deciding whether or not a piece of writing of mine should be public for everyone to see or private to me. Recently, I’ve came up with a process for deciding which posts should be “semi-public” and which ones should just be for me to see. 

If it’s a rant or a piece of writing for you to “work your thoughts through”, then it should be private. If there’s any info in the piece that includes personal stuff you’re not intentionally trying to disclose, then it should be private. If it’s just a re-edition of your journal entry, don’t make it public. 

When writing “semi-publicly”, which means that it’s available online but that you only share the link with trusted people, don’t mention the names of friends instead use their pronouns or their first initial instead.  

Update: A sent me some texts and they’re so encouraging! She said that it’d be interesting to see the patterns in what past and future versions of you choose to write about :) And that my future work can inspired by my past work. Pretty much as a bridge between the past, present, and future. 

I love the idea of having my own corner of the internet for 5 or more years to come.
