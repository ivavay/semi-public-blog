I'm pretty much done with the scales unit on this udemy course! This unit was pretty fun as I learned about different scales and when to use them through the example of making a heatmap. In the example, we used a dataset that contained the incomes of people in various socioeconmic classes in America. In the end, I learned that the threshold scale is the most customizable since it allows you to set the thresholds yourself instead of relying on D3 to automatically make them for you. I'm probably gonna end up reading on scales some more and see if I can make anything to practice with it :)
