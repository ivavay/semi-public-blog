I met with one of my favorite artists yesterday in SF at Precita Park yesterday. It was super inspiring to get to know her and her creative process/thoughts on pursuing artistic endeavors, for career and for personal interests. She offered to take a look at my portfolio, which was really nice of her. And she gave me a 20-min ride to Japantown, which was crazy since SF is such a hassle to drive. Anyways, Iâ€™m grateful for this in-person hangout and I think chatting with her has given me the creative fuel to keep on improving my craft for the upcoming months, whether that be 3D or 2D illustrations.
