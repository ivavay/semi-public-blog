\- I pretty much added this reverse % to both the index.njk and tags.njk.

\- Right now, I still can't include \`index.html\` code snippet I think.

\- Eventually, I'd want to [group posts by year](https://jamesdoc.com/blog/2021/11ty-posts-by-year/) as tags.

\- I am also trying to see if spotify embed works.
