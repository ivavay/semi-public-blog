*I'm liking this idea of writing monthly recaps + resets as we wrap up the end of the year and venture into the next. Months go by so quick nowadays that it'll be nice to jot down a few highlights / favorites and re-prioritize what I'll focus on in the upcoming month. So here is it is on a recap of November and a refreshing reset for the most festive month of the year ðŸŽ„*

November was busy (compared to October at least) in terms of job searching. There was this company that I was interviewing for and got to the second round with, but then they told me right after I presented on the spot that I'm just too junior for them at the moment. I was pretty sad after that cuz there's nothing I can do about being "too junior", especially when it completely contradicted what they said in the first call about being okay with training those who are transitioning into the field. Then, I started interviewing with this one dev tool company whose product I tried out over one weekend and really loved! I finished the portfolio presentation with two designers and am hoping there would be next steps :) My wifi is trash at home so I went to the library, but the library didn't want to cooperate today during the call so there goes my luck! 

I haven't been in the headspace to work out this November at all (sigh!) because I guess I was just constantly in this waiting-to-hear-back and anxious phase. But I will start doing this Xmas advent calendar at-home workout program beginning this week. And speaking of advent calendars, I'm also participating in this Javascriptmas daily challenge by Scrimba to brush up on my rusty JS skills. 

It's almost at the end of the year and this is when I'm noticing I have so many unfinished things that I've started with, such as books and courses. For start, I think I'm gonna try to finish this really good sci-fi thriller called Recursion and this memoir called Beautiful Country. I'm typically a memoir/essays/nonfiction reader but I'm trying something different with this sci-fi thriller because it's about memory and neuroscience! I'm halfway through Beautiful Country and it's been a really great read that reminds me of my childhood readjusting to the environment in America. 

I also started taking this 5-week long pottery class at the community center near my house! We're learning wheel throwing next week, which I'm super excited for. I brought home by block of clay so I'm going to try to make one or two handbuilt mugs before Sunday.

Also made this block-printed tote bag that's pottery inspired!

This December, I think I'll focus on completing just three things that I've started this year and have not finished. I also want to make some illustrative holiday cards to give to friends/families but have no ideas at the moment. And call my grandma more! :)
