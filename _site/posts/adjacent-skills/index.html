    <h1>Adjacent skills</h1>
<p class="extra">August 18, 2021</p>

<p class="extra-top"><p>I need to stop being so guilty spending time cultivating my hobbies. Not all of your time has to be spent on investing in your career path to justify that you’re trying hard. A career path from a grad standpoint may seem linear, but I have a feeling that things will change and that’s when you will thank yourself for having spent all those time on your adjacent skills. I wish people can celebrate adjacent skills and interests rather than condemn them as “distractions” or “you’re spreading yourself too thin”. Maybe, one day those things that you’ve once considered as a “space of their own” will converge in ways you’ve never expected.</p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.polywork.com/">Polywork</a> and I really like their mission of giving people a place to celebrate their multiple identities and mini-milestones in a &quot;change log&quot; fashion. However, my first impression was that it seems like it's encouraging people to track/post their achievements rather than process. I personally value process more than achievements and would love to see a platform where people can share their journey of going from A to B.</p>
