    <h1>Reminiscing about Taiwan</h1>
<p class="extra">August 18, 2021</p>

<p class="extra-top"><p>It's been almost 5 months since I've moved back to the Bay from after living in Taiwan for half a year. I really want to move there again towards the end of this year once the covid situation gets better because I can pretty much do what I do there but with so much more freedom. I just feel more creatively charged and inspired there. Everyday mundanity hits so different there compared to here. The city just feels like it has so many hidden gems and interactions waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>The creative park @ Songsan was one of the places that I'd constantly go because it had a hidden library that I adored and just overall really good aesthetics every corner you turned.</p>

<p>There was a pop-up shop for screen printing for a while and I'd always be there to make stuff. Also, the buildings here make good backdrops and cast nice shadows for shooting portraits, so I was able to take a few photos for my cousin. Oh yeah, and there were the Eslite bookstore and the food court inside the park too, which made it so easy to stay there for one good one whole afternoon.</p>
<p>I also remembered riding the bus to NTU a lot to take this coding class there on the weekends. There were so much good street eats around that area and I often stuck around to get food before heading home.</p>
<p>Taiwan, I hope to be back really soon! But until then, stay safe ðŸ’ž</p>
